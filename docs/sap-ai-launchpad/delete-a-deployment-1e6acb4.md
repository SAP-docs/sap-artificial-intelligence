# Delete a Deployment

You can delete a deployment if it is no longer required. Deletion removes information about a deployment but does not delete the objects involved.

## Prerequisites

You have the `mlfunctions_editor` role, or you have been assigned a role collection that contains this role.

For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](roles-and-authorizations-4ef8499.md).



## Context

You can delete a deployment if it has the status *Dead*, *Stopped*, or *Unknown*. For deployments in other statuses, the *Delete* button is not enabled.
