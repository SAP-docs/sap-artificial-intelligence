# Scenarios

As an AI scenario consumer, you subscribe to an AI service. The AI service comes with predefined AI use cases which are called scenarios.

A scenario has a business purpose, such as determining AI insights from a recommendation system or review classification feedback.

In the *Functions Explorer* app, a scenario consists of templates that you use to implement the AI use case within your service. A scenario can have multiple versions which correspond to different template versions.

A template consists of code that defines the components required for your AI pipeline. A pipeline can be used to train a model, or to deploy a model.

Scenarios and their templates are available to all AI scenario consumers.

> ### Note:  
> You use scenarios with your own input datasets and parameter values to generate models. Your datasets and generated models are unique to you and are not available to other AI scenario consumers.
