# Deployment Templates

A deployment template is used to deploy an AI model.

A deployment template defines placeholders for key data such as:

-   Model \(in most cases\)

-   Parameters

    Hyperparameter values for the model \(variables that affect the decision-making capability of the model\)


Values for parameters and other inputs are provided by a configuration. To start the deployment process with these values, a deployment is created with the configuration.
