# Manage Repositories

You can maintain a list of Git repositories for use within your AI processes.



## Context

Git repositories are used for storing versions of training and serving templates.

You use the *SAP AI Core Administration* app to add Git repositories to your instance of SAP AI Core \(your AI runtime\). You can add multiple repositories, edit their details, or remove a repository if it is no longer required. The Git repositories you define are available for selection and use in applications.
