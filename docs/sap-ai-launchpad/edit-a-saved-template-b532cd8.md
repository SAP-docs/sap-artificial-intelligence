## Prerequisites

-   You’ve selected the AI API connection and resource group that you used in the activation steps.

-   You have either the `genai_manager` or `prompt_manager` role, or you are assigned a role collection that contains one of these roles. For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](security-e4cf710.md#loio4ef8499d7a4945ec854e3b4590830bcc).


> ### Note:  
> Prompts and templates are saved in one region only and can only be retrieved or deleted by an instance of AI launchpad in that region.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your desired template. For more information, see [View a Saved Template](view-a-saved-template-cfe6c8b.md).

2.  Choose the entry for the version you want to edit.

3.  Choose *Open in Prompt Editor*. Make your changes.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you change the access level of your template, you'll create a separate template item. Both templates can be updated and saved independently of each other

    > ### Note:  
    > If the model used for your prompt is no longer available you will be notified when you open the prompt in the editor and you must choose another model.
