<tr>
<td valign="top">

Configuration

</td>
<td valign="top">

A way of binding values \(for datasets or models and input parameters\) with a specific version of an executable or template.

A configuration is used in both training and serving processes, to either train or serve a model.

</td>
</tr>

Dataset

</td>
<td valign="top">

A dataset references a data source and the instruments required to access it.

Each dataset is uniquely identified by ID.

The dataset ID is used in a configuration to bind the dataset as input to an executable, and use it in training a model.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Deployment

</td>
<td valign="top">

A serving process that deploys a model. A deployment creates a model server and generates a deployment URL that is used for inference \(to make predictions\).

-   A serving executable or deployment template defines the expected parameters and input dataset that is required for the serving process.

-   Values for parameters and input model or dataset are provided by a configuration. A deployment takes one or more models and parameters from a configuration.

-   A deployment is created to start the deployment process with these values.


Deployments that are implemented on an SAP AI Core runtime that produces `HTTPS` endpoints.

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Deployment template

</td>
<td valign="top">

A template that is used to serve or deploy one or more trained models.

A deployment template defines the parameters and inputs \(provided by a configuration\) which are used when the template is instantiated.

Deployment templates are used in the *Functions Explorer* app.

A deployment template is called a serving executable in the *ML Operations* app.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Executable

</td>
<td valign="top">

Code that defines the training pipeline or model deployment pipeline.

Executables have placeholders:

-   Input artifacts, which provide datasets or models

-   Parameters, which are custom key-pair values supplied within the code


Placeholders help you to reuse the same template when training or deploying a model.

In the *Functions Explorer* app, executables are called templates.

For more information, see [Executables](executables-06f4794.md) and [Templates](templates-442a7e8.md).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Execution

</td>
<td valign="top">

An execution is an instance of a workflow executable. The execution will start the actual training pipeline or batch-inferencing pipeline using the values for input artifacts and parameters set by configuration.

An execution produces AI models after training and result sets after batch inferencing.

In the *Functions Explorer* app, an execution is called a run.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Model

</td>
<td valign="top">

A model is generated by a training process. A model consists of files stored in a hyperscaler storage

Each model is uniquely identified by a model ID. The model ID is used in a configuration to bind the model as an input artifact to the serving executable for deployment.

-   Models can be manually uploaded \(to the connected data storage\)

-   Models can be generated from an execution \(and automatically uploaded to the connected data storage\)




</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Output artifact

</td>
<td valign="top">

The name of the artifacts \(usually AI models\) that are generated by an execution or run.

When AI models are generated from an execution, they are automatically uploaded and registered to the connected hyperscaler data storage.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Parameter

</td>
<td valign="top">

Type of placeholder in an executable to which a value is attached \(String, INT, or Float\). The values are provided by configurations, and are used in executions or deployments.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Resource group

</td>
<td valign="top">

A resource group represents a unique namespace created for an AI runtime \(such as SAP AI Core\).

Within a resource group, users create and manage entities such as configurations, executions, deployments, and artifacts.

See [Resource Groups](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/CLOUD/en-US/26c6c6b50e3f412f8bc0cd6a8ebdb850.html).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Result set

</td>
<td valign="top">

A result set is an artifact that is the result of a batch inference run \(execution\). A batch inference run will use a dataset as an input artifact and write the result into an output artifact \(result set\).

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Run

</td>
<td valign="top">

A run is a training process that generates a model or models.

-   A run template defines the expected parameters, input dataset, and output model that is generated from the training process.
