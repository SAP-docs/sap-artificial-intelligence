# Run Templates

A template that is used to train an AI model is called a run template .

A run template defines the following:

-   Parameters

    Hyperparameter values \(variables that affect the decision-making capability of a model\)

-   Inputs

    The dataset on which a model is trained, see [Datasets](datasets-f4bebd4.md)

-   Outputs

    The model that is the result of the training process, see [Models](models-c3caa37.md)


Values for parameters and other inputs are provided by a configuration. To start the training process with these values, a run is created with the configuration.
