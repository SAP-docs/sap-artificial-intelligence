# AI Scenario Producer

As an AI scenario producer, you develop AI use cases \(scenarios\) on one or more AI runtimes and productize them.

An AI runtime is the infrastructure on which your AI technology is implemented. SAP AI Core \(AI runtime\) is compatible with SAP AI Launchpad. The assumption throughout this guide is that SAP AI Core is used as the AI runtime.

When you are responsible for managing the lifecycle of the AI scenario, SAP AI Launchpad provides support in the following ways:

-   You can manage the operations and lifecycle tasks of the AI scenarios on multiple instances of AI runtimes, such as SAP AI Core, for all of your AI scenario consumers.

-   AI scenario producers can access logs to provide support to AI scenario consumers.


Based on the roles assigned to you, within SAP AI Launchpad, you can:

-   Use the *Workspaces* app to create and manage connections to multiple instances of AI runtimes which implement the AI API \(such as SAP AI Core. For more information, see [Workspaces](workspaces-c804f14.md).
-   Use the *ML Operations* app to manage tasks over the lifecycle of your AI scenarios. For more information, see [ML Operations](ml-operations-df78271.md).
