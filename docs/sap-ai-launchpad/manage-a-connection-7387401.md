## Procedure

1.  In the *Workspaces* app, find the connection.

    Each connection appears as a tile. You can search the connections by entering the name or part of the name in the :mag: field.

2.  Select the connection and choose one of the following options:

    -   Choose *Delete* to remove the connection from SAP AI Launchpad.

        > ### Note:  
        > Deleting a connection does not delete data associated with the service used by the connection.

    -   Choose *Edit* to update the settings for the connection.

        > ### Tip:  
        > You can't change the name of a connection after it has been created. However, you can delete the connection and re-create it with the required name.
        >
