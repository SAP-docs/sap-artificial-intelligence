<a name="loio36ddabf56bf9402e980f0a7d4fe225fe__prereq_vsn_vrt_qxb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have the `aicore_admin_resourcegroup_editor` role or a role collection that contains it. For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/docs/ai-launchpad/sap-ai-launchpad/roles-and-authorizations).

Your tenant has been onboarded and a default resource group automatically created.
