## Prerequisites

You have the `mlfunctions_editor` role, or you have been assigned a role collection that contains this role.

For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](security-e4cf710.md#loio4ef8499d7a4945ec854e3b4590830bcc).



## Context

You can stop a deployment if it has the status *Running* or *Pending*, which means that computing resources have been allocated for the deployment. For deployments in other statuses, the *Stop* button is not enabled.



## Procedure

1.  Find the deployment and display its details. See [Investigate a Deployment](investigate-a-deployment-28463c4.md).

2.  Choose *Stop* in the deployment's header.

3.  In the *Warning* dialog, choose *Stop*.
