Labels Associated with Artifacts



</td>
<td valign="top">

In the *ML Operations* app, you can now view all the labels that are associated with an artifact \(that is, a model, dataset, or result set\) on the overview and details pages for the artifact. This helps you to view the additional metadata that is associated with the artifact.

When you create a configuration in either the *ML Operations* or *Functions Explorer* app, you can now see the type of artifact and the associated labels. This helps you to select the correct artifact to be used as the configuration input.

In both the *ML Operations* and *Functions Explorer* apps, you can use the label to search and filter the artifacts on the overview page.
