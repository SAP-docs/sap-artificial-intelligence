# Compare Executions

You can compare executions to determine which configuration parameters result in optimum results.

You can compare up to five executions, either by comparing metric data or by creating and analyzing charts.

-   Metrics provide data about the quality \(confidence\) of a model. Model quality is affected by the dataset used in the execution \(training process\) and by the input configuration parameters.

    When you compare metrics for executions, multiple execution metrics are compared against input configuration parameters. You compare metric data to determine whether further adjustments are required for configurations, or to identify a configuration which is producing optimum results.

-   Charts provide a visual representation of an execution and resulting model quality. You can choose the chart settings and chart type to graphically compare executions. Chart types include line, bar, column, heat map, and scattered charts. The chart types available for use depend on your source data and chart settings. You can preview a chart before you add it to your chart view.
