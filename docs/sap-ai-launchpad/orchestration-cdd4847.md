# Orchestration

Orchestration combines content generation with a set of functions that are often required in business AI scenarios.

Functions include:

-   Templating, which lets you compose a prompt with placeholders that are filled during inference

-   Content filtering, which lets you restrict the type of content that is passed to and received from a generative AI model
