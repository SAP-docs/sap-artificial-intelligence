# Update from Free Tier to Standard Plan

Learn how to update from a free tier option to a standard plan for SAP AI Launchpad.



## Context

If you first subscribe to the free tier option, you can migrate the same service instance to a standard service plan \(for enterprise accounts\).

> ### Tip:  
> -   If you update from the free tier option to standard, your metadata and transaction data, including trained models, are also migrated \(for enterprise accounts\).
> 
> -   If you don't want data from the free tier option and standard service plans to be combined, you can keep them separate by subscribing to the service plans in separate subaccounts.
> 
> -   It is not possible to migrate from a standard service plan to a free tier option.

For more information about updating from a free tier to paid plan on the SAP BTP cockpit, see [Update to a Paid Service Plan](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans#update-to-a-paid-service-plan).



## Procedure

1.  Open your global account in the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your subaccount.

3.  In the navigation area, choose *Instances and Subscriptions*.

    A list of the applications to which your subaccount is subscribed in the Cloud Foundry environment is displayed.

4.  Search for SAP AI Launchpad.

5.  Select the ellipsis at the end of the subscription row, and from the menu, select *Update*.

6.  In the wizard that opens, select *default* and click *Update*.

## Results

After you have updated to a standard plan, free tier usage limits no longer apply. The update automatically migrates your data from the free tier plan to the standard plan.
