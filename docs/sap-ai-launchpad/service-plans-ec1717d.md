## Changing Service Plans

If you first subscribe to the free plan option, you can migrate the same service instance to a standard service plan \(for enterprise accounts\). If you migrate from the free plan option to standard, your metadata and transaction data, including trained models, are also migrated \(for enterprise accounts\). It is not possible to migrate from a standard service plan to the free plan option.
