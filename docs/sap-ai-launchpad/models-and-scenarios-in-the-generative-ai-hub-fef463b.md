# Models and Scenarios in the Generative AI Hub

The generative AI hub is available in SAP AI Core only with the `extended` service plan.

To use the generative AI hub, you must have one of the following roles or a role collection that contains one of the roles:

-   `genai_manager`

-   `prompt_manager`

-   `genai_experimenter`

-   `prompt_experimenter`


Note that users with only the `genai_experimenter` or `prompt_experimenter` roles cannot save prompts.

Individual models are provided as executables in the form of serving templates, and accessed by choosing the corresponding template for the desired model.

The following scenarios are available:
