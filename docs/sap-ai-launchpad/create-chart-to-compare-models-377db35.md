## Context

You create a chart to visualize metrics for:

-   A single model, or

-   Multiple models, comparing up to five models against timestamp, step, or configuration parameters

You can find and compare models at either scenario or run template level. You can create multiple charts and view them in the *Chart View*.

> ### Note:  
> Each chart can compare data for up to five models.

## Procedure

1.  In the *Functions Explorer* app, find and display a scenario. See [Investigate a Scenario](investigate-a-scenario-4547979.md).

2.  List the models for comparison:

    -   To list models for a scenario, select the *Associated Contents* tab.
    -   To list models for a run template, find and display the run template. See [Investigate a Run Template](investigate-a-run-template-b753dc0.md). Then select the *Associated Contents* tab.

4.  **Optional:** If you have a large list of models, you can further filter the list by choosing <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Filter\).

5.  Select the models for comparison and choose *View Metrics*.

    The *Metrics Overview* appears for the selected models. The model IDs and descriptions are listed in the *My Selection* pane. The *Metrics Comparison* pane defaults to the chart view.
