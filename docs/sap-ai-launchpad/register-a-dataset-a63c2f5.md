# Register a Dataset

Use the *ML Operations* app to manually register a dataset that is stored in your object store.



## Prerequisites

You have the `artifact.register` role, or you have been assigned a role collection that contains this role. For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/docs/ai-launchpad/sap-ai-launchpad/roles-and-authorizations).

Details for the object store secret have been added using the *SAP AI Core Administration* app. See [Add an Object Store Secret](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_LAUNCHPAD/92d77f26188e4582897b9106b9cb72e0/5b4f728c8f21403697728687f96e03c6.html).

## Context

After you've registered a dataset, you can use it as input for configurations in the *ML Operations* app.

> ### Caution:  
> If the files for a registered dataset are deleted from your object store, or if the datapath or object store secret changes, then the registered dataset can no longer be used.

## Procedure

1.  Choose the resource group. For more information, see [Set Resource Group](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_LAUNCHPAD/92d77f26188e4582897b9106b9cb72e0/0c077289f29d4147921fb07ab0f68b7f.html).

2.  In the *ML Operations* app, choose *Datasets*.

    The *Datasets* screen appears listing all of the datasets for the selected resource group.

3.  Choose *Add* to manually register a dataset.

    The register dataset wizard appears. This wizard has five steps.

4.  Enter the details for the dataset.

    1.  In the *Scenario* step, choose the scenario in which the dataset will be used.

    2.  In the *General Information* step, specify a name and description for the dataset.

    3.  In the *URL* step, enter the URL for the dataset in your object store.

        > ### Tip:  
        > URLs must adhere to the following convention `ai://<objectStore name>/<data path>`.

    4.  In the *Labels* \(Optional\) step, enter any labels and values that you would like to apply to the dataset.

    5.  In the *Review* step, confirm the details that you've provided for the dataset.
