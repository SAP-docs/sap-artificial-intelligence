## Procedure

1.  In the *Functions Explorer* app, choose *All Scenarios*.

2.  Find the deployment template and display its details. See [Investigate a Deployment Template](investigate-a-deployment-template-0f68ee0.md).

3.  Choose *Deploy* to create a new deployment.

    The *Create New Deployment* wizard appears. This wizard has four steps.

4.  Select the required data for the new deployment. Note, the scenario and deployment template are prefilled from your previous selections.

    1.  In the *Select Configuration* step, select the required configuration. The details for the selected configuration are displayed in the right pane. Confirm the selection and choose *Review*.

        > ### Tip:  
        > If there is no configuration which matches your data requirements, you can choose *create a configuration*. You will be redirected to create a configuration and your deployment will be lost. When you have saved the new configuration, you can re-create the deployment with the new configuration. See [Create a Configuration](create-a-configuration-03fa29f.md).

    2.  In the *Review* step, confirm the data that you've selected for the deployment. Choose *Create* to create the deployment.

    The new deployment is created and its details displayed.
