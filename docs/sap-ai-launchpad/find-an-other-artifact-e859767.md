## Procedure

1.  Choose the resource group. For more information, see [Set Resource Group](set-resource-group-0c07728.md#loio0c077289f29d4147921fb07ab0f68b7f).

2.  In the *ML Operations* app, choose *Other Artifacts*.

    The *Other Artifacts* screen appears listing all associated artifacts. Other artifacts are listed by name, and with additional details such as description, ID, scenario, URL, execution ID, labels, created on timestamp, and changed on timestamp. Each artifact has a unique *ID*.

3.  **Optional:** Search the list by entering an artifact name or part of its description in the :mag: field.

    > ### Tip:  
    > When your runtime is SAP AI Core, this search is not case-sensitive. For other runtimes, search may be case-sensitive.

4.  **Optional:** Filter the list by choosing <span class="SAP-icons">ÓÅ∂</span> \(Filter\). The *Filter* dialog appears.

    2.  Choose *Add* to include the filter criteria. Adjust the conditions as needed.

    3.  Choose *Apply* to apply the filter and conditions to the list.


5.  Check the *Labels* column for the number of classifying phrases/ names applied to the artifact. Labels are specified when registering the artifact to the selected resource group.
