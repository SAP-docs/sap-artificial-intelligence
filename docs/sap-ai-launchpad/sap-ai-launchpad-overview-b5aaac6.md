# SAP AI Launchpad Overview

The SAP AI Launchpad service is intended to be used together with the SAP AI Core and the `AI API`.

The key components are SAP AI Core, SAP AI Launchpad, and the `AI API`.

-   **SAP AI Core** provides an engine that lets you run AI workflows and model serving workloads.

-   **SAP AI Launchpad** manages a number of AI runtimes. It allows various user groups to access and manage their AI scenarios.

-   **AI API** provides a standard way of managing the AI scenario lifecycle on different runtimes, regardless of whether they are provided on SAP technology \(such as SAP S/4HANA\) or on partner technology \(such as Amazon Web Services\). When the AI API is deployed on runtimes other than SAP AI Core, the runtimes have to provide a runtime adapter.
