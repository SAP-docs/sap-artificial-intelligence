## Edit a Connection



<a name="loio79c1de643cd5478194cae46505e84026__steps_rcz_gp4_rrb"/>

## Procedure

1.  In the *Workspaces* app, find the connection.

    Each connection appears as a tile. You can search the connections by entering the name or part of the name in the :mag: field.

2.  Select the connection and choose *Edit* to edit the connection's details.

    The *Update AI API Connection* dialog box appears.

3.  Change the connection details as required.

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can't change a connection name once it has been created, However, you can delete the connection \(no data is lost\) and add a new connection to the same runtime instance with a new name. See [Delete a Connection](manage-a-connection-555c83b.md#loiofc28f574020a466e8b03b8805055eb79).
    > 
    > Sensitive fields are masked and entries are not shown in clear text. To ensure these entries are accurate, copy and paste the values from your service key.

    -   You can upload the service key file for your SAP AI Core instance, if available.

        To upload the service key as a `.TXT` or `JSON` file, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î„®</span> \(Upload\) . Search for and choose the local service key file.

        Service key data then defaults to the remaining fields.


4.  Choose *Update*.
