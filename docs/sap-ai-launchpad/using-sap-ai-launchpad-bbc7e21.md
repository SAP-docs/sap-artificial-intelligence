# Using SAP AI Launchpad

SAP AI Launchpad can be used by both AI scenario producers and AI scenario consumers. AI scenario producers, such as AI operations engineers or AI engineers, are responsible for developing and productizing AI scenarios. AI scenario consumers, such as business analysts, subscribe to a service that offers an AI scenario and consume it.



Scenarios can be managed by either the AI scenario producer or the AI scenario consumer.
