# Runs

A run is a training process that generates a model or models. A run is an instance of a run template \(an AI pipeline\), created using a configuration.

## About Runs

A run is used to train a model or for other AI workflows.

![Run template plus configuration results in a run.](images/AIL_FE_Run_Equation_d7a8b01.png)

-   A run template defines the expected parameters, input dataset, and output model that is generated from the training process.

-   Values for parameters and input dataset are provided by a configuration.

-   A run is created to start the training process using the provided values.

-   A run generates a model.


Runs are associated with a large volume of metadata, as well as training/ model performance, and other training data. Metadata is stored as metrics \(and associated labels\), tags, and custom info. Multiple metrics, tags and custom info can be stored with a single run. Once metric, tag and custom info are saved to a run, they can be queried with a run ID.

You can view runs and individual run details in the *Functions Explorer* app, as follows:

-   To see runs for all scenarios, navigate to the *All Runs* screen.

-   To see runs for a specific scenario, navigate to the *All Scenarios* screen. Choose a scenario and select the *All Runs* tab.

## Runs and Models

You can expect to experiment iteratively with the datasets and configuration parameters until your model reaches the expected benchmark.

## Run States

Runs can have any of the following states:

-   Pending
-   Running
-   Stopping
-   Stopped
-   Completed
-   Dead
-   Unknown

The following figure shows how run states can change following the initial state of *Pending*:

   
  
**Run State Flow**

 ![](images/Job_State_Flow_f9f2a4a.png "Run State Flow") 

The AI runtime refers to the infrastructure of your subscribed AI service. When a run state changes from *Running* to the next state, the computing resources that were used by the AI runtime are released.
