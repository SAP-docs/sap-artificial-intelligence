# Other Artifacts

Any artifact that cannot be categorized as a dataset, model, or result set is registered as an other artifact.

An artifact is a reference to a file stored in hyperscaler object storage.

SAP AI Launchpad can be used with multiple hyperscaler object stores, such as Amazon S3, OSS, and WebHDFS.

Artifacts are unique to a resource group.

**About Other Artifacts Registration**



-   An artifact can be manually registered using SAP AI Launchpad \(see [Register an Other Artifact](register-an-other-artifact-c02fca9.md)\). You register an artifact using the *ML Operations* app. After you register an artifact, you'll see it listed with all other artifacts in the app.

-   An other artifact set can be manually registered using SAP AI Core \(see [Create Artifacts](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/808d9d442fb0484e9b818924feeb9add/CLOUD/66413f1d9fbf4758a0d739eaf1c95dc7.html)\).
