# Example End-to-End Use Case

To become familiar with the fundamentals of using SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad, you can refer to the developer tutorials.

## Getting Started

The developer tutorials demonstrate how you can use SAP AI Launchpad together with an AI API connection to SAP AI Core. Before you start to work through the tutorials, you must set up your SAP AI Core instance. For more information, see the tutorials available within [Create Your First Machine Learning Project Using SAP AI Core](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-get-started-basics.html).

> ### Recommendation:  
> An assumption throughout the developer tutorials is that you use SAP AI Core as the AI runtime. SAP AI Core is not included in the subscription of SAP AI Launchpad. It is a separate product and requires a separate subscription.
