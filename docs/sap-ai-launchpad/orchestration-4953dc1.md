# Orchestration

Orchestration combines content generation with a set of functions that are often required in business AI scenarios.

Functions include:

-   Templating, which lets you compose a prompt with placeholders that are filled during inference

-   Content filtering, which lets you restrict the type of content that is passed to and received from a generative AI model
-   Data Masking, which lets you mask data via anonymization or pseudonymization before passing it into a genereative AI model. In case of pseudonymization masked data present in the generative AI model response will be unmasked.

-   Gounding, which lets you integrate external, contextually relevant, domain-specific, or real-time data into AI processes. This data supplements the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained models, which are trained on general material.
