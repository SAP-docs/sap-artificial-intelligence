<a name="loio873d7c6a1fe8429592b2b2efe74227b2__prereq_jxh_cq2_rob"/>

## Prerequisites

You have the `aicore_admin_dockerregistrysecret_editor` role or a role collection that contains it. For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](roles-and-authorizations-4ef8499.md).

You have access to the Docker registry over the Internet.

## Context

You edit a secret when its credentials \(user name and access token\) change.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot change the name for a secret. If the name is no longer valid or contains errors, you'll need to remove the secret and re-create it with the correct details. See [Remove a Secret](remove-a-secret-5161312.md).

    The *Edit Docker Registry Secret* window appears. The name can't be changed, and the *Secret* field is empty.

4.  Enter the secret.

    1.  To copy the secret, copy the contents of the `data` parameter, as provided to you. The secret is between the parentheses. Paste the data into the *Secret* field.

    2.  To upload the secret as a `.TXT` or `JSON` file, choose <span class="SAP-icons">î„®</span> \(Upload\) . Search for and choose the secret from a local file. The file data then defaults to the *Secret* field.

        > ### Note:  
        > Files which are larger than 10 KB can't be uploaded.


5.  Choose *Edit* to save the changes for the secret.
