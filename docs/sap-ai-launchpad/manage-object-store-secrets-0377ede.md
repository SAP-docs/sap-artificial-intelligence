# Manage Object Store Secrets

You can connect your AI processes with a cloud object store, and manage access using an object store secret.

A cloud object store enables you to store files that you use in your launchpad processes. Files can include models, datasets, result sets, or other types of artifact used within model training, serving, or inferencing processes.

Cloud storage credentials are managed using secrets. Secrets are a means of allowing and controlling connections across directories and tools, without compromising your credentials.

Various hyperscaler object stores are supported, including Amazon S3, Alicloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\), Azure and SAP HANA Cloud, data lake \(WebHDFS\).
