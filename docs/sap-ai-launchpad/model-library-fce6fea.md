## Prerequisites

You have the `genai_experimenter`, `genai_manager`, `genai_administrator` or `orchestration_executor` role, or a role collection that contains one. For more information, see [Roles and Authorizations](security-e4cf710.md#loio4ef8499d7a4945ec854e3b4590830bcc).

## Context

Model library contains information on models available in the generative AI hub to aid decision making.

To explore models available in generative AI hub and their metadata, use the catalog mode.

To inform your decision making using benchmarking data, use the leaderboard mode.

To view detailed information for a single model such as data input types, cost information and metrics where available, view its model card.

## Procedure

1.  Select the connection to your SAP AI Core runtime in the *Workspaces* app.

2.  You can use model library without selecting a resource group. However, if you select a resource group you will be able to use models directly through the model library later.

    **Optional:**Choose the resource group that was used for your generative AI hub deployment.

3.  In the side navigation, expand the *Generative AI Hub* and choose *Model Library*.
