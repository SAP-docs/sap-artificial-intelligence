# Manage Generic Secrets in SAP AI Core 

As the main tenant user of the SAP AI Core runtime, you can create, edit, and delete generic secrets at the level of both the main tenant and the resource group. To do so, you use *SAP AI Core Administration* app.



## Context

Generic secrets differ from system secrets and can be used to store sensitive information without exposing your credentials.

They are used to store and retrieve secrets, where a system secret is not appropriate.

They are used during AI development both at the tenant level and resource group level.
