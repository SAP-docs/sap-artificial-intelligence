# Manage Generic Secrets in SAP AI Core 

Main Tenant users of the SAP AI Core runtime can create, edit and delete generic secrets at both the main tenant and resource group levels of SAP AI Core, through the *SAP AI Core Administration* app.



## Context

Generic secrets are different to system secrets and can be used to store sensitive information without exposing your credentials.

They are used to store and retrieve secrets, where a system secret is not appropriate.

They are used during AI development both at the tenant level and resource group level.
