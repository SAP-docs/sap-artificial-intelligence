# Manage Resource Groups

A resource group represents a unique workspace environment, where users can create or add entities such as configurations, executions, deployments, and artifacts.

Resource Groups are managed by registering, updating deleting or consuming generic secrets. Secrets are a means of allowing and controlling connections across directories and tools, without compromising your credentials.
