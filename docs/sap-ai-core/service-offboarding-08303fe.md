# Service Offboarding

Tenant offboarding occurs when a customer deletes a subaccount. SAP AI Core polls for the subaccount deletion event and performs the necessary deprovisioning and deletion activities.

> ### Note:  
> Data and resources are not deleted when a service instance is deleted \(because we don't isolate based on the service instance\). If you want to keep the subaccount but still deprovision SAP AI Core, create a **medium** [support ticket](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#incident/create) on component `CA-ML-AIC` with the title ***Service Offboarding*** and request that your data and resources be deleted manually.
