# Manage Artifacts

An artifact is a reference to data or a file that is produced or consumed by an execution or deployment. They are managed through SAP AI Core and your connected object store.

The object store secret contains the credentials to access your cloud storage that contains your data. You can locate and copy this to your machine, using artifacts. In the following examples, you will need to replace *<ai://default\>* with the values that you used when registering the object storage. Please follow the naming convention outlined in the diagram below to formulate your path.
