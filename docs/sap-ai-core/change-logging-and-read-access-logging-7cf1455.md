# Change Logging and Read-Access Logging

SAP AI Core acts as the data processor and is not aware of the type of data or category of data. SAP AI Core customers, as Data Controllers, are responsible for fulfilling data protection and privacy \(DPP\) responsibilities for data storage and processing requirements.

For any applications or services you develop using SAP AI Core, you must ensure that they include relevant logging functions, and ensure compliance with the data privacy laws by making sure that the data is properly logged.
