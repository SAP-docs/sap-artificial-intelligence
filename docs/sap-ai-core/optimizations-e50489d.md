# Optimizations

Optimizations lets you evaluate and refine your generative AI workflows and prompts.

Key features of optimizations include:

-   **Evaluations:** Systematically assess and validate AI model performance using evaluation workflows and metrics. Manage the complete lifecycle of your evaluation processes and analyze results to ensure your AI solutions meet quality standards before deployment. For more information, see [Evaluations](evaluations-14699b0.md).
-   **Prompt Optimization:** Enhance prompt effectiveness by optimizing templates against target datasets to maximize specified performance metrics. Leverage prompt registry integration and systematic testing to improve model outputs and achieve better alignment with business objectives. For more information, see [Prompt Optimization](prompt-optimization-f5af0bd.md).
-   **Metrics:** Monitor model performance using built-in and custom indicators to ensure your AI applications meet business requirements. For more information, see [Metrics](metrics-8f2c277.md).
