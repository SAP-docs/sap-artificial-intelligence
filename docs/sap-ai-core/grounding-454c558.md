# Grounding

Grounding integrates external, contextually relevant, domain-specific, or real-time data into AI processes. This data supplements the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained models, which are trained on general material.

Grounding is a service designed to handle data-related tasks, for example grounding and retrieval, using vector databases.

The Pipeline API is proxied through the SAP AI Core generative AI hub, and incorporates vector stores, such as the managed HANA database.

Grounding provides specialized data retrieval through vector databases, grounding the retrieval process using your own external and context relevant data. Grounding combines generative AI capabilities with the capacity to use real-time, precise data to improve decision-making and business operations, for specific business AI driven solutions.
