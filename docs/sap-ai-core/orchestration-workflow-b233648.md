# Orchestration Workflow

In a basic orchestration scenario, you can combine different modules from orchestration into a pipeline that can be executed with a single API call. Within the pipeline, the response from one module is used as the input for the next module.



The order in which the pipeline is executed is defined centrally in orchestration. However, you can configure the details for each module and omit optional modules by passing an orchestration configuration in JSON format with the request body.
