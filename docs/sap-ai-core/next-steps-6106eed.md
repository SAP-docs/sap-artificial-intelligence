# Next Steps

In the section above, we've outlined the basic steps for model consumption.

If you're interested in exploring advanced use cases for enhancing LLM responses with capabilities like grounding, data masking, and content filtering, see [Orchestration](orchestration-8d02235.md).

Alternatively, you can deploy and consume models using direct model access. For more information, see [Foundation Models](foundation-models-2d981fb.md).
