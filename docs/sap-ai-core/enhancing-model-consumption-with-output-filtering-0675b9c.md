# Enhancing Model Consumption with Output Filtering



<a name="loio0675b9c77d40467bb2f87b6474e95a80__section_vr2_rpj_12c"/>

## Prerequisites

You have a running orchestration deployment and have retrieved your orchestration deployment URL. For more information, see [Get Your Orchestration Deployment URL](get-your-orchestration-deployment-url-ec7c703.md) and [Create a Deployment for Orchestration](create-a-deployment-for-orchestration-4387aa7.md).

## Process

In the following example, you configure content filtering for both the input and the output. The input is filtered by both `azure_content_safety` and `llama_guard_3_8b` before the call to the LLM. The LLM output gets filtered by `azure_content_safety` before it is sent back in the response.

  },

  }
}'
```

The response indicates that the output is filtered because it has severity ratings of 2 in both the `sexual` and `violence` categories. However, it doesn't violate the `llama_guard_3_8b` hate category. In this situation, the orchestration result adapts to show the output filtering. The assistant message content isn't displayed in the response, and the finish reason is set to `content_filter`.
