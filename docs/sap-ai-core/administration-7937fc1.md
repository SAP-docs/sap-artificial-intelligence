# Administration

Creating secrets for external programs and tools, that are used with SAP AI Core means that you can connect them without compromising your credentials.

Using SAP AI Core alongside external tools such as GitHub, Docker and Amazon Web Services S3 storage leverages the benefits of version control, containerization and cloud storage. Your content is made available remotely, if you have a stable internet connection.

Administration is a one time procedure, but steps can be repeated if necessary, for example to remove or add a tool.

> ### Note:  
> You must have completed the initial setup tasks before configuring your SAP AI Core instance. For more information, see [Initial Setup](initial-setup-38c4599.md).
