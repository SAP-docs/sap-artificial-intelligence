## Changing Service Plans

If you first subscribe to the free tier option, you can migrate the same service instance to a standard service plan \(for enterprise accounts\). If you migrate from the free tier option to a standard plan, your metadata and transaction data, including trained models, are also migrated \(for enterprise accounts\). It is not possible to migrate from a standard service plan to the free tier option.
