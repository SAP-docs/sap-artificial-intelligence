# SAP AI Core Starter Tutorials

You can use a booster to get started with the free plans for SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad using the tutorial: [AI Boosters](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ai-core-launchpad-provisioning.html).

Alternatively, to complete the booster tutorial, then learn the basics of SAP AI Core from beginning to end in a simple use case, follow the tutorial: [Quick Start for SAP AI Core](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-get-started-basics.html). If you have already provisioned SAP AI Core, you can skip through to the second tutorial in this guide.

To see the complete library of tutorials available for SAP AI Core, see [Tutorials](tutorials-a5c80a6.md).

> ### Note:  
> Once you have provisioned SAP AI Core, you can access the service in multiple ways. Where the tutorial below offers more than one option tab, you need only complete the tab for your chosen method of access. For customers who prefer a GUI to code, SAP AI Launchpad is recommended. For more information, see [SAP AI Launchpad.](https://help.sap.com/docs/ai-launchpad/sap-ai-launchpad/what-is-sap-ai-launchpad)
