# Security and Customer Data Protection

SAP product standard security and the data protection and privacy \(DPP\) requirements set high standards and obligations when it comes to securing and protecting customer data that is entrusted to SAP.

Customer data protection is handled in three ways:

-   Customer data is imported, output, and processed by the services for no purpose beyond that to which the customer has subscribed.
-   Customer data is protected from malicious access by security technologies that include authentication and authorization.
-   Customer data is protected from accidental exposure to SAP administrators or support persons by security policies, access controls, and monitoring.
