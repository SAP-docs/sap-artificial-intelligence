## Metaflow Python Library for SAP AI Core

Download the software development kit \(SDK\) for SAP AI Core from the Python Package Index \(PyPI\). This Python library is a plugin that lets you generate workflow templates that can be executed in SAP AI Core.

Metaflow is an open source tool to boost the productivity of data scientists. The Metaflow Python library for SAP AI Core extends Metaflow's capabilities so that machine learning pipelines can be run on Argo Workflows \(which are also used in SAP AI Core\).

For more information, see [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sap-ai-core-metaflow/).
