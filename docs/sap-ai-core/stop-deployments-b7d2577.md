[List Executables](list-executables-6af8e60.md "An executable is a reusable template that defines a workflow or pipeline for tasks such as training a machine learning model or creating a deployment. It contains placeholders for input artifacts (datasets or models) and parameters (custom key-pair values) that enable the template to be reused in different scenarios.. You can list all of the executables in a resource group and get details of specific executables from a resource group. Serving templates are mapped to deployment executables.")
