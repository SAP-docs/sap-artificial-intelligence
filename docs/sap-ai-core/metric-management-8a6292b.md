## Perquisites

You're using the simplified workflow. For more information, see [Custom Metrics](custom-metrics-35dcc3e.md)

You have prepared your custom metric for prompt management. For more information, see [Register Evaluation Artifacts](register-evaluation-artifacts-19412e0.md), and [Create an Evaluation](create-an-evaluation-77ebfe5.md).



## Context

You can:

-   Define and create metrics in a structured way.

-   Manage multiple versions of each metric definition as your use cases evolve.

-   Track immutable revisions within each version, ensuring full reproducibility and auditability.


By separating metric definitions from your application logic, the service enables safe experimentation and updates without disrupting ongoing workflows. This ensures that new ideas can be tested, validated, and rolled out confidently while preserving the integrity of existing metrics.
