# Foundation Models

The foundation models service operates under the global AI scenario `foundation-models`, which is managed by SAP AI Core.

You can access foundation models by creating a deployment for the model that you want to use. To do this, you'll need an auth token from your SAP AI Core instance. For more information, see [Get an Auth Token](get-an-auth-token-0808d42.md) and [Create a Deployment for a Generative AI Model](create-a-deployment-for-a-generative-ai-model-b32e7a8.md).
