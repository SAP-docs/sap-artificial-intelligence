# Output Translation

The output translation module is optional. It allows you to translate LLM output into a chosen target language.

To use output translation, configure it as part of your orchestration workflow.

The module supports SAP's Document Translation service \(part of the SAP Translation Hub\).

> ### Caution:  
> Output translation is performed **after** any configured output unmasking. Unmasked output is sent to the translation service.
