## Context

Your default resource group contains a running orchestration deployment. You can use this URL across your organization to access orchestration in the generative AI hub.



## Procedure

1.  Send a GET request to the endpoint `$AI_API_URL/v2/lm/deployments` and include the default resource group in the header.

    ```
    curl --request GET $AI_API_URL/v2/lm/deployments \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        --header "AI-Resource-Group: default"  
    ```

2.  In the response, search for the deployment object where the `configurationName` is `defaultOrchestrationConfig`, and note the `deploymentUrl` associated with this deployment.

3.  Set the value of the returned `deploymentUrl` as an environment variable.

    ```
    ORCH_DEPLOYMENT_URL="<deployment_url>"
    ```
