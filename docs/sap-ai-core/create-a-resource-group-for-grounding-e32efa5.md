# Create a Resource Group for Grounding



<a name="loioe32efa5402154101b4cc05c03ef5be09__section_vcf_xqs_dgc"/>

## Prerequisites

Resource groups represent a virtual collection of related resources within the scope of one SAP AI Core tenant. When your tenant is onboarded, a default resource group is created immediately. Further resource groups can be created, or deleted by your tenant administrator with the AI API. Tenants can map the resource groups based on the corresponding usage scenarios.

If your SAP AI Core tenant uses resource groups to isolate the scenario consumer tenant and the resource groups are subsequently deleted, the scenario consumers will be deprovisioned. SAP AI Core is not aware of the scenario consumer of the tenant. The standard XUSAA multitenancy model is followed.

For more information, see [Scope of Resources](scope-of-resources-c9518c0.md).



## Procedure

1.  Create a resource group by sending a curl request, including the label that makes the resource group available to the grounding service.

    > ### Note:  
    > Resource group Ids must be of length minimum: 3, maximum: 253. The first and last characters must be either a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, or a number. Character entries from the second to penultimate can include a lower case letter, an upper case letter, a number, a period \(.\), or a hyphen \(-\). No other special characters are permitted.

    Set the following in the headers:

    -   `AI_API_URL`: the base URL of your SAP AI Core environment.
    -   `{{resource_group}}`: The AI resource group ID or document grounding management
    -   `{{access_token}}`: Your access token for SAP AI Core

    ```
    curl --location --request POST "$AI_API_URL/v2/admin/resourceGroups" 
    --header "Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
      "AI-Resource-Group": "{{resource_group}}", 
      "labels": [
        {
          "key": "ext.ai.sap.com/document-grounding",
          "value": "true"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

    Existing resource groups can be made available to the grounding service using a `PATCH` request, including the `document-grounding` label.

## Next Steps

To provide data chunks for ingestion without registering a repository, use the Vector API data management API. For more information, see [Vector API](vector-api-08e3d00.md).

To register a repository to use as part of a grounding pipeline, create a generic secret for grounding for the repository of your choice. For more information, see [Generic Secrets for Grounding](generic-secrets-for-grounding-e1a201c.md).
