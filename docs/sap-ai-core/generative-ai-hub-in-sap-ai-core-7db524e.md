# Generative AI Hub in SAP AI Core

The generative AI hub incorporates generative AI into your AI activities in SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad.

LLMs are self-supervised, deep learning models that have been trained on vast amounts of unlabeled data. They leverage AI technology and industrial-scale computational resources to learn complex language patterns and semantic knowledge bases for natural language processing \(NLP\) tasks. They parse input, such as prompts, and by predicting a target word, can return contextually relevant responses written in natural language. A single LLM can perform multiple NLP tasks by using different input formats and output modes.

LLMs are general models but can be fine-tuned with additional embeddings for specialized or domain-specific use cases.

SAP AI Core and the generative AI hub help you to integrate LLMs and AI into new business processes in a cost-efficient manner.
