# Retrieve Execution Logs

Information about API processing and metrics, are stored and accessed in the deployment and execution logs.



You can retrieve the logs for a specific deployment or execution by submitting a GET request. Use the following endpoints to retrieve the logs:

-   `GET /v2/lm/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs`

-   `GET /v2/lm/executions/{executionsId}/logs`


Query parameters include:

-   `start` : the start time for a query as a string, in RFC 3339-compliant datetime format. Defaults to 1 hour before the current. Example:`2021-05-19T00:00:14.347Z`

-   `end` : the end time for a query as a string, in RFC 3339-compliant datetime format. Defaults to the current time. Example: `2021-05-19T00:00:14.347Z`

-   `$top` : the maximum number of entries returned. The default value is 1000; the maximum is 5000.

-   `$order` : the sort order of logs, either `asc` \(for ascending, earliest in the order will appear at the top of the list\) or `desc` \(for descending, most recent in the order will appear at the top of the list\). Note the default value is `asc`.


For example:

-   `/v2/lm/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs?start=2021-05-19T00:00:14.347Z&end=2021-05-19T01:00:14.347Z&$top=100&$order=asc` - returns the first 100 lines of a deployment log between **2021-05-19T00:00:14.347Z** and **2021-05-19T01:00:14.347Z**

-   `/v2/lm/deployments/{deploymentId}/logs` - returns deployment logs from the preceding hour

-   `/v2/lm/executions/{executionsId}/logs` - returns execution logs from the preceding hour

## Using Postman

1.  Create a new GET request and enter the URL `{{apiurl}}/v2/lm/executions/{{executionId}}/logs`.

    ![](images/Get_Execution_Logs_with_Postman_fba5a3b.png)

2.  On the *Authorization* tab, set the type to *Bearer Token*.

3.  Set the token value to ***\{\{token\}\}***.

4.  On the *Header* tab, add the following entry:

    ****


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Key


    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Value


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">

    *ai-resource-group*


    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">

    <Name of your resource group\> \(in the example, default is used\)


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
5.  Send the request.

## Using curl

```
curl --request GET "[/pandoc/div/div/horizontalrule/codeblock/span/code
     {"filepath"}) $AI_API_URL/v2/lm/executions/$EXCUTION_ID/logs?start=2021-05-19T00:00:14.347Z (code]" --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" --header "ai-resource-group: $RESOURCE_GROUP"
```
