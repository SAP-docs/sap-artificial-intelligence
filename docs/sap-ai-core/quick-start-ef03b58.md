## Procedure

To get started, complete the following steps:

1.  [Get an Auth Token](get-an-auth-token-0808d42.md): This step provides instructions on how to obtain an authentication token, which is necessary for accessing SAP AI Core services securely.
2.  [Get Your Orchestration Deployment URL](get-your-orchestration-deployment-url-ec7c703.md): This step guides you through retrieving the URL for your orchestration deployment, which is essential for model consumption.
3.  [Consume Models with the Harmonized API](consume-models-with-the-harmonized-api-2392d9a.md): This step explains how to use the Harmonized API to interact with and consume your deployed AI models without creating multiple deployments.
4.  [Next Steps](next-steps-6106eed.md): This section outlines the subsequent actions you can take after completing the initial simple model consumption, such as exploring further orchestration capabilities \(grounding, content filtering, data masking\)
