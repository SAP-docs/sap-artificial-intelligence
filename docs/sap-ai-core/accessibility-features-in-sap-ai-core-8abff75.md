# Accessibility Features in SAP AI Core

To optimize your experience of SAP AI Core, SAP AI Core provides features and settings that help you use the software efficiently.



> ### Note:  
> SAP AI Core uses SAP AI Launchpad for its interface, which is based on SAPUI5. For this reason, accessibility features for SAPUI5 also apply.
