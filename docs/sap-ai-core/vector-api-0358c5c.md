# Vector API

The Vector API allows you to provide chunks of documentation directly and store data in the vector database.

You can use the Vector API to:

-   Create collections.
-   Create documents by directly using chunks of data.
-   Store data in a vector database.
-   Provide repository IDs to access the data.

> ### Caution:  
> Do not expose personally identifiable or privileged information in your documents or chunks when using generative AI hub. Personally identifiable information is any data that can be used alone, or in combination, to identify the person that the data refers to. The document grounding capability has no mechanism for determining the type of data that it processes, and does not filter confidential or other privileged information.
