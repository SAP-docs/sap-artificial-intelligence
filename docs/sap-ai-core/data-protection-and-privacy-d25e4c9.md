# Data Protection and Privacy

For general information about data protection and privacy on SAP Business Technology Platform, see [Data Protection and Privacy](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/7e513d31704a4a87831191e504ca850a.html).

Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns. In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts, it is necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries/regions. This section describes the specific features and functions that SAP AI Core provides to support compliance with the relevant legal requirements and data privacy.

This guide does not give advice on whether these features and functions are the best method to support company, industry, regional, or country/region-specific requirements. Furthermore, this guide does not give advice or recommendations about additional features that would be required in a particular environment. Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis and under consideration of the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.

> ### Note:  
> SAP does not provide legal advice in any form. SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and specific data protection-relevant functions, such as simplified blocking and deletion of personal data. In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws will not be covered by a product feature. Definitions and other terms used in this document are not taken from a particular legal source.

The extent to which data protection is ensured depends on secure system operation. Network security, security note implementation, adequate logging of system changes, and appropriate usage of the system are the basic technical requirements for compliance with data privacy legislation and other legislation.
