# Use an Orchestration Config in LLM Orchestration



## Prerequisites

You have created an orchestration config. For more information, see [Create an Orchestration Config](create-an-orchestration-config-2f27317.md).



## Context

Orchestration configs can be used in LLM Orchestration completion requests in the following ways:

1.  **Inline configuration**: Define the configuration directly in the request
2.  **Reference by ID**: Reference a stored config by its unique ID
3.  **Reference by name, scenario, and version**: Reference a stored config by its metadata



## Procedure

You can reference orchestration configs using the following methods:

Set the following in the headers:

-   `AI_API_URL`: the base URL of your SAP AI Core environment.
-   `{{access_token}}`: Your access token for SAP AI Core



### Method 1: Reference Orchestration Config by ID

Send a POST request to the LLM Orchestration completion endpoint with a config reference by ID.

```
curl -X POST "{{apiurl}}/v2/completion" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_auth_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "config_ref": {
             "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479"
           },
           "placeholder_values": {
             "userQuery": "What are the benefits of SAP AI Core?",
             "inputContext": "enterprise AI platform"
           }
         }'

```



### Method 2: Reference Orchestration Config by Name, Scenario, and Version

Send a POST request to the LLM Orchestration completion endpoint with a config reference by metadata.

```
curl -X POST "{{apiurl}}/v2/completion" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_auth_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "config_ref": {
             "scenario": "customer-support",
             "name": "example-orchestration-config",
             "version": "0.0.1"
           },
           "placeholder_values": {
             "userQuery": "How do I integrate with SAP AI Core?",
             "inputContext": "API integration"
           },
           "messages_history": [
             {
               "role": "system",
               "content": "You are helping with technical integration questions."
             }
           ]
         }'

```



### Method 3: Inline Configuration \(for comparison\)

You can also use orchestration configurations inline without storing them first.

```
curl -X POST "{{apiurl}}/v2/completion" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_auth_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "config": {
             "modules": {
               "prompt_templating": {
                 "prompt": {
                   "template": [
                     {
                       "role": "user",
                       "content": "{{?userQuery}}"
                     }
                   ]
                 },
                 "model": {
                   "name": "gpt-4o-mini"
                 }
               }
             }
           },
           "placeholder_values": {
             "userQuery": "What is SAP AI Core?"
           }
         }'

```

> ### Note:  
> Use stored orchestration configs \(methods 1 and 2\) when you have reusable configurations that multiple applications or workflows need to access. Use inline configurations \(method 3\) for one-off or experimental requests.

> ### Note:  
> When referencing orchestration configs in LLM Orchestration:
> 
> -   Reference by ID provides immutability meaning that the config behind the ID will never change
> -   Reference by name, scenario, and version provides flexibility meaning that you get the latest iteration of that version
