# Manage Object Store Secrets

Connect SAP AI Core to a cloud object store and manage access using an object store secret. The connected storage is used as storage for your dataset, models and other cache files of the Metaflow Library for SAP AI Core.

Your cloud storage credentials are managed using secrets. Secrets are a means of allowing and controlling connections across directories and tools, without compromising your credentials.
