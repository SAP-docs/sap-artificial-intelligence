# Create a Deployment for Orchestration





<a name="loio4387aa7a9fa44402822ad6bc3631f846__prereq_nzn_mdw_tyb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have an SAP AI Core service instance and service key. For more information, see [SAP AI Core Initial Setup Documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/38c4599432d74c1d94e70f7c955a717d.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=CLOUD).
-   Youâ€™re using the `extended` service plan. For more information, see [Service Plans](service-plans-c7244c6.md) and [Update a Service Plan](update-a-service-plan-924f892.md).
-   You have completed the client authorization for your preferred user interface. For more information, see [Use a Service Key in SAP AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/3a97465bf6164400a4b5c1641007e3d6.html?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT&version=CLOUD).

-   You have at least one orchestration-compatible deployment for a generative AI model running. For more information, see [Models and Scenarios in the Generative AI Hub](models-and-scenarios-in-the-generative-ai-hub-729dd9e.md).

## Context

You create a deployment to make orchestration capabilities available for use. After the deployment is complete, you get a `deploymentUrl`. You can use this URL across your organization to access orchestration in the generative AI hub.

## Using Postman



<a name="task_emp_lcz_bcc__steps_upf_pcz_bcc"/>

## Procedure

1.  Check that you have access to the `orchestration` scenario containing generative AI by sending a GET request to `{{apiurl}}/v2/lm/scenarios`.

    Set the *Authorization* header with `Bearer $TOKEN` and set your resource group.

    > ### Note:  
    > You must use the same resource group for all of your generative AI activities. To use a different resource group, these steps must be repeated for each resource group.

    The scenarios listed contain a scenario with the id `orchestration`.

2.  Create a configuration by sending a POST request to the endpoint `{{apiurl}}/v2/lm/configurations`.

    Include the following parameters:

    -   `name` is your free choice of identifier.

    -   `executableId` must be `orchestration`.

    -   `scenarioId` must be `orchestration`.

    -   `versionId` is your own version reference.


    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > {
    > 	"name": "yourNameChoice",
    > 	"executableId": "orchestration",
    > 	"scenarioId": "orchestration",
    > 	"versionId": "0.0.1",
    > }
    >    
    > ```

    You receive a unique `configurationId` in the response.

3.  Create a deployment by sending a POST request to the endpoint `{{apiurl}}/v2/lm/deployments`.

    Include the `configurationId` from the previous step in your request.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > {
    >  "configurationId": "yourConfigurationId"
    > }
    > ```

4.  Retrieve the details of your deployment by sending a GET request to the endpoint `{{apiurl}}/v2/lm/deployments`.

## Using curl



<a name="task_yn2_tcz_bcc__steps_cdn_ycz_bcc"/>

## Procedure

1.  Create a configure for the orchestration deployment.

    Orchestration is exposed via the global scenario `orchestration` and the executable `orchestration`.

    1.  Send the following request:

        ```
        curl --request POST "$AI_API_URL/v2/lm/configurations" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
          --header "ai-resource-group: $RESOURCE_GROUP" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --data-raw  '{ 
            "name": "orchestration-config", 
            "executableId": "orchestration", 
            "scenarioId": "orchestration"
          }'
        ```

        The response appears as follows:

        > ### Output Code:  
        > ```
        > {
        >   "id": "f7ac7f77-e70f-4e9c-86b5-1504b44fe789",
        >   "message": "Configuration created"
        > }
        > ```

    2.  Take the `id` of the configuration and set it as an environment variable.

        ```
        ORCH_CONFIG_ID=f7ac7f77-e70f-4e9c-86b5-1504b44fe789
        ```


2.  Create the deployment for orchestration using the configuration `id`:

    1.  Send the following request:

        ```
        curl --request POST $AI_API_URL/v2/lm/deployments \
            --header 'content-type: application/json' \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
            --header "ai-resource-group: $RESOURCE_GROUP" \
            --data-raw "{
                \"configurationId\": \"$ORCH_CONFIG_ID\"
            }"
        ```

        The response appears as follows:

        > ### Output Code:  
        > ```
        > {
        >   "deploymentUrl": "",
        >   "id": "d4168482710c6cf9",
        >   "message": "Deployment scheduled.",
        >   "status": "UNKNOWN"
        > }
        > ```

    2.  Take the `id` of the deployment response and set it as an environment variable.

        ```
        ORCH_DEPLOYMENT_ID=d4168482710c6cf9
        ```


3.  Wait for the deployment to start.

    It takes a few minutes for the orchestration deployment to reach the status RUNNING. You can check the status of the deployment using the deployment `id`.

    ```
    curl --request GET "$AI_API_URL/v2/lm/deployments/$ORCH_DEPLOYMENT_ID" \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        --header "ai-resource-group: $RESOURCE_GROUP"
    ```

    If the output looks as follows \(that is, the status is RUNNING\), the deployment is ready. If not, try again after a couple of minutes.

    ```
    {
      "configurationId": "f7ac7f77-e70f-4e9c-86b5-1504b44fe789",
      "configurationName": "orchestration-config",
      "createdAt": "2024-06-20T14:40:16Z",
      "deploymentUrl": ,
      "details": {
        "resources": {
          "backend_details": {}
        },
        "scaling": {
          "backend_details": {}
        }
      },
      "id": "d4468482710c6cf9",
      "lastOperation": "CREATE",
      "latestRunningConfigurationId": "f7ac7f77-e70f-4e9c-86b5-1504b44fe789",
      "modifiedAt": "2024-06-20T14:48:03Z",
      "scenarioId": "llm-orchestration",
      "startTime": "2024-06-20T14:41:22Z",
      "status": "RUNNING",
      "submissionTime": "2024-06-20T14:40:18Z",
      "targetStatus": "RUNNING"
    }
    ```

4.  Set the value of the returned `deploymentUrl` as an environment variable.

    The `deploymentUrl` is available only when the deployment has the status RUNNING.

    ```
    ORCH_DEPLOYMENT_URL="<deployment_url>"
    ```
