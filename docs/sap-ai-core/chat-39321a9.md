# Chat

Orchestration can also be used in chat scenarios. The following example shows how to configure the templating module to use a chat prompt.

## Prerequisites

You have a running orchestration deployment and have retrieved your orchestration deployment URL. For more information, see [Get Your Orchestration Deployment URL](get-your-orchestration-deployment-url-ec7c703.md) and [Create a Deployment for Orchestration](create-a-deployment-for-orchestration-4387aa7.md).

## Process

```

```

As shown above, messages from the chat can be passed to the current request using the `messages_history` parameter. In this case, the chat history contains several user messages and assistant responses. The templating module is then configured with the current user message, which is used to generate the next assistant response. The templating module appends the current user message to the message history to generate the prompt that is sent to the LLM module.

The response contains the messages from the chat history and the response to the new message. The output of `module_results.templating` and the `orchestration_result.choices` results can be used as the message history for a subsequent inference request:
