# Foundation Model Tutorials

We provide tutorials that demonstrate use cases for accessing generative AI models in the generative AI hub using foundation scenarios. To access each model version, youâ€™ll need to create a separate deployment.

For a complete list of tutorials on foundation models, see [Generative AI with SAP AI Core - Foundation Models](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-foundation-models.html).
