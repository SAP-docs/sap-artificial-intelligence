Where direct access to files in the object store is not possible or desirable \(for example, in Content as a Service Scenarios, where the Service Consumers might not be the owners of the object store\) you can upload, download, and delete files from the pre-registered object store using the SAP AI Core Dataset API.

For full details on the Dataset API specification, see [SAP AI Core Dataset API documentation](https://api.sap.com/api/AI_CORE_API/resource/File).
