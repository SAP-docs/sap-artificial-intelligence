# Contributions to SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step to one of our procedures that could save others a lot of time? Then you're in the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if appropriate, are added to our official documentation on SAP Help Portal at [SAP AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/d029a32c22fb45fbb607e6a2c48c8a0e.html?version=CLOUD) and [SAP AI Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_LAUNCHPAD/92d77f26188e4582897b9106b9cb72e0/760889ab809841c8a8905ca492f902cb.html?version=CLOUD). The easiest way is to start there, find the page that you want to contribute to, and choose _Edit_ to access the corresponding Markdown file.

## Requirements

Before you can contribute, you must have a GitHub account. For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) in the GitHub documentation.


## Contributing

We recommend using the SAP AI Core or SAP AI Launchpad documentation on SAP Help Portal as the starting point for your contributions:

1. Open the [SAP AI Core](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/d029a32c22fb45fbb607e6a2c48c8a0e.html?version=CLOUD) or [SAP AI Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_LAUNCHPAD/92d77f26188e4582897b9106b9cb72e0/760889ab809841c8a8905ca492f902cb.html?version=CLOUD) documentation.
1. From here, you can:
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Edit page* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Create issue* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
